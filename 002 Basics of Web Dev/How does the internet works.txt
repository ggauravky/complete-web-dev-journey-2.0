How the internet works

1. The internet is many computers and devices connected together.
2. Devices use common rules called protocols (like TCP/IP) to talk.
3. When you open a website, your device sends a request to the website's server.
4. The server sends the page back as small pieces called packets.
5. Routers and switches pass packets between networks to reach their destination.
6. Packets can take different paths and are reassembled at your device.
7. DNS is like a phone book â€” it turns site names into IP addresses.
8. HTTPS (encryption) keeps your data private while it travels.
