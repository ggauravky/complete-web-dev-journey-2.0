Frontend, Backend and APIs — Short pointers (easy words)

Frontend
- What it is: The part of a website or app you see and interact with.
- Examples: Buttons, forms, images, menus, text, layout, colors.
- Built with: HTML (structure), CSS (looks), JavaScript (behavior).
- Role: Makes things look good and lets users do things (click, type, scroll).
- Think of it like: A shop’s display window and the counter where customers interact.

Backend
- What it is: The behind-the-scenes part that powers the app.
- Examples: Storing user accounts, saving posts, sending emails, running logic.
- Built with: Server languages (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.), databases (MySQL, MongoDB).
- Role: Receives requests from frontend, processes data, and returns results.
- Think of it like: The stockroom and staff handling orders and inventory.

API (Application Programming Interface)
- What it is: A simple door or messenger between frontend and backend (or between services).
- Examples: Endpoints like GET /users, POST /login, PUT /cart.
- Role: Defines how to ask for or send data (rules, formats like JSON).
- Think of it like: A restaurant menu and waiter — you request something and get a response.

How they work together (quick flow)
1. User clicks a button on the frontend.
2. Frontend calls an API endpoint (e.g., POST /send-message).
3. Backend receives the API call, does work (save message, check auth).
4. Backend returns data via the API.
5. Frontend updates the UI with the returned data.

Simple real-world analogy
- Frontend = store window + cashier (customer-facing).
- Backend = kitchen + warehouse (does the work).
- API = the waiter who carries requests and replies between them.

Key points to remember
- Frontend = user experience (UX). Backend = data and rules.
- APIs use simple formats (usually JSON) to move data.
- You can change frontend without changing backend if API contract stays the same.
- Security matters on both sides: validate input on backend, protect user data.
